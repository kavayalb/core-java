1.Java is high level programming language.
  java is invented Games Gosling in 1995 may
  java is a high Speed
  java is a platform independent
  it perform high compare to other language c,c++
  Ex:filename.java
  
  javac 
  Javac is java Compiler when the Code end its compile the code
  .class cant need to compile the code

2.JDK [Java Development Kit]
  its write and exicute the program'
  it consists of Libraries + JRE[Java Run-time Environment]
  Libraries + JRE =JDK
  its loades verfies and exicutes the program
  
  JRE[Java Run-time Environment]
  its used to exicute the program.
  its consists of tools+JVM.

  JVM [Java Virtual Machin]
  it is used to convert the java code into byte code is called JVM
  .byte code into java code(.class)
  the .class files is no need to compile,

3. .java file: it is a java exicution,which is used in the store the file in the particular java file 
   .class: it is the copy of the .java file to class file, .class file is not need to compile
 
4. Java Intigreted Development Edition : it is a platform to run the java code
   a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs. Many IDEs provide features like syntax highlighting and code completion, which help the user to code more easily.

5.Variable is a storing the information
  Variable doesnot allow Spaces
  Variable can be accesed
  Variable are Declared in 4 ways
          > Literals 
          > Method
          > Constructors
          > Reference
  Literals are initialize the values to the reference variable
  Ex: String name="kavya";
  Method are the collection of Statement or it is a byte of code its exicute when its call,
  Constructor is a special method
              it is a non static special method
              same name as the class name
              no return type,
  Reference Variable it holds the address of the another variables
                    its storing the information of the other class
  Variable can divided into 2 types
      1. Class Variable                
          > Static Variable
          > non-static Variable/Instance Variable
      2. Method Variable
          > Local Variable
          > Parameter Variable

6. Object-Oriented Programming in java
   oop's Concept in java is very important thing
   Object is a real time entity,what we can see the living and non-living tings
   Object is a instance of class,
   C,C++ are the Object-oriented Programmin language
   it has 4 principle
   * Inheritance  
   * Polymorphism
   * Encapsulation
   * Abstraction
  
  * Inheritance : it Acquring the properties of another class
                  its derving the base class to the sub class
                  its extracking the properties of the parent class to child class
            is has some types
            > Single Inheritance
            > Multiple Inheritance
            > Multilevel Inheritance
            > Hybrid Inheritance
            > Hyrachiel Inheritance

  * Polymorphism :  it has two word poly means many morphism means forms
                    same name but different Functionalities
                    Ex: car is the name Accelrater,break,gear, this are functionalities
                    Polimorphism : is classified has Two types
                       1. Compile time Polimorphism
                           > Class Overloading
                           > Method Overloading
                       2. Run time Polimorphism

  * Encapsulation : Wrapping up of data
                    wrapping up of a code in to the one place or single unit
                    Ex: Bank Account
  * Abstraction : it is a hiding the infomation
                  the process of hiding the implementation of details.
                  Abstraction is a keyword
     Ex: Car
         when we start the car by using the key what we dont need to know how to start the car/ how to start the engine

7.Error

8. Data type
   the values and sizes are stored with respective Data types
   types of data stored in the data types
   its is used to memory storage
   Data types are classified into two types they are
   1. Primitive Data types: is a predefined data types
      they are 8 types
         1.int
         2.float
         3.byte
         4.boolean
         5.long
         6.double
         7.char
         8.short
      Ex: class Person{
               String name;
               int age;
          }

  2. Non-Primitive Data types : What we declared its non-primitive
      its infinite non-primitive data types
        1.Array
        2.class
        3.hashes
        4.String
          .......etc
    Ex: laptop,mobile,watch......
        
9. Dot operator is used to access the variable name and method from the class
    Ex: class Academic{
	
	static void syllabus(){
		System.out.println("syllabus");
	}
   System.out.println("syllabus");
   
   System : is the Class name
   out : is the variable name
   println : is the method name

10. Java is high level programming language.
    java is invented Games Gosling in 1995 may
    java is a high Speed
    java is a platform independent
    it perform high compare to other language c,c++
    Java is a general purpose programming language
    Multithreading
    Secure
    Robust
    Speed
    Object-oriented
    Ex:java filename

11. Array is the collection of same type of element
    or array is collection of references
    array is a primitive data type
    Array can be declared by using []
    Array initialize start with the 0,1,2,3,.......n
    Ex; n=[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],.......[n]
     
   class abc
   {
    int a[]={1,2,3,4,5,};
   }

12. Class
    class is a keyword
    class is collection of objcet
    class is templet,blue print
    the class name Should be in Capital letter
    Syntax : class name
             {
               //code
             }
    
    Ex: Class Laptop                   class Object{
        {                               public static void main(String[] args){   
         String brand;                  System.out.println("Hello");
         doublr price;                 }
        }                             |}

    Object 
    Object is a real time entity
    its is a instance of class
    whatever is see in the world living and non-living things are the Objects
    Ex: Mobile
        Telivision
13. Keyword is the pre-defined words
    they are 48 keywords in java
    new
    Abstract    final
    Continue    finally
    byte        throw
    boolean     throws
    break
    class        
    char
    int
    for
    float
    while
    default
    assert
    void
    if
    instance
    import
    impliment
    super
    this
    Ex: 
       class MatchBox{
	
	String brand;
	int noOfSticks;
	double length;	
	MatchBox(String brand){
		
		this.brand=brand;
		System.out.println("MatchBox brand is: "+brand);
	}
	MatchBox(String brand,int noOfSticks){
		
		this.brand=brand;
		this.noOfSticks=noOfSticks;
		System.out.println("MatchBox brand is: "+brand+" noOfSticks are "+noOfSticks);
	}
	MatchBox(String brand,int noOfSticks,double length){
		
		this.brand=brand;
		this.noOfSticks=noOfSticks;
		this.length=length;
		System.out.println("MatchBox brand is: "+brand+"\n noOfSticks are "+noOfSticks+" \nlength is "+length);
	}
       	public static void main(String[] matchboxes){
			
		MatchBox matchbox=new MatchBox("lion");
		System.out.println("MatchBox brand is :"+matchbox.brand);
		System.out.println("MatchBox noOfSticks is :"+matchbox.noOfSticks);
		System.out.println("MatchBox length is :"+matchbox.length);

		MatchBox matchbox1=new MatchBox("lion",50);
		System.out.println("MatchBox1 brand is :"+matchbox1.brand);
		System.out.println("MatchBox1 noOfSticks is :"+matchbox1.noOfSticks);
		System.out.println("MatchBox1 length is :"+matchbox1.length);
       }
}


14. Constructor 
    is a special method
    is a non-static special method
    is a same name as class name 
    no return type
    Constructor has 3 types
      1.default Constructor
      2.parameterized Constructor
      3.copy Constructor
  Ex:
       class MatchBox
      {
       String brand;

       MatchBox(String brand)
      {
	System.out.println("MatchBox brand is: "+brand);
      }
    }
15. Because Static can access the class name
    non-static can access the reference name
    Java provides some pre-defined ( system defined) methods, for example System. out. println(), but user defined methods can also be created.

16.class Array
   {
   Public Static Void main(String [] args)
   {
     int[]num={12,3,2,45,6,7,6};
     System.out.println("length of the array")
   }
   }

17.Method are the collection of Statement or it is a byte of code its exicute when its call,
   
   Method and Method Overloading
   we can say that Method overloading is a concept of Java in which we can create multiple methods of the same name in the same class, and all methods work in different ways.
   When more than one method of the same name is created in a Class, this type of method is called the Overloaded Method
   EX: 
   class Kidney{
	
	 String shape;
	 double noOfkidney;
	 boolean available;
	 int size;
	 double cost;

      Kidney(){
	System.out.println("Kidney created....");
     }
    public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("Starting maain in Kidney");
		Kidney kidney=new Kidney();
		System.out.println("Kidney shape is:"+kidney.shape);
		System.out.println("Kidney noOfkidney is:"+kidney.noOfkidney);
		System.out.println("Kidney available is:"+kidney.available);
		System.out.println("Kidney size is:"+kidney.size);
		System.out.println("Kidney cost is:"+kidney.cost);
		Kidney kidney1=new Kidney();
		System.out.println("Kidney shape is:"+kidney1.shape);
		System.out.println("Kidney noOfkidney is:"+kidney1.noOfkidney);
		System.out.println("Kidney available is:"+kidney1.available);
		System.out.println("Kidney size is:"+kidney1.size);
		System.out.println("Kidney cost is:"+kidney1.cost);
		System.out.println("Ending maain in Kidney");
	}
}
